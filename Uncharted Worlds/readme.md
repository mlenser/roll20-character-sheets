#### Version 1.1 | Release Date: 2016-12-13
This is my first shot at a Roll20.net custom character sheet.

Hints & Features: 
- rolls for stats are automated. Just click on the icon next to the stat.
- Stats have to be entered with "+ or -". 

Todos
- Replace front/back radio buttons with something pretty
- scaling doesn't work too well
- implement user dialog for Moves that use "any" as a stat. (mover to v.1.2, together with clickable moves on the backpage)

After clicking the Move, the sheet needs to prompt the user for the stat to use, then roll.
Currently these Moves are not clickable.
